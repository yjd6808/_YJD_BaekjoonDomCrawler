Each contraction may appear as listed, entirely uppercase, or capitalized (first letter uppercase, remaining letters as listed).

If more than one case applies, choose the earliest matching case in the list: \"as listed,\" \"uppercased,\" and \"capitalized.\""},{"paragraph":"Since acronyms are useful for understanding and identifying names, only modify the first instance of an acronym in each text. An instance of an acronym must match the case exactly (\"acm\" is not an instance of \"ACM\"). The modification consists of replacing the acronym with the expansion, followed by a space, followed by the acronym in brackets. This allows the reader to connect the acronym with the fully expanded term."},{"paragraph":"The terminating line of '#' should be printed after each text.
